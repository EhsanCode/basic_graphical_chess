# Basic Graphical Chess
## Story
In 1999 when I lost a chess game to my friend [@hajk1](https://github.com/hajk1), a professional chess player,  we decided to develop a chess game program in C++. As second-year computer engineering students, It wasn't only a programming exercise, but also a teamwork challenge. We stopped working on this program in 2000 and left it as you can find here. 
## Programing environment
Turbo C++ 3.0
